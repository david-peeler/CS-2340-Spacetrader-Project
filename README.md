# CS-2340-Spacetrader-Project

This game was developed by a team of 4 throughout the entire semester of CS 2340 taken at Georgia Tech.

# Outline

This game simulates what it's like to be a space trader, traveling around the galaxy exploring new economies. The object of the game is to buy/sell items in order to develop a cash stack, survive barbarian attacks, and eventually find & buy the end game item, that makes you an all powerful being.


# Objectives taken away from the building of the game:
  - Using git/version control, especially in a large scale enviroment
  - Developing and using UML documents effectively
  - Applying standard design practices to large scale code
  - Creating and developing test cases
  - Working in a team enviroment
